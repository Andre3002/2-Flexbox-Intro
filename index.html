                    <p>
                        I’m a new software developer located in the Washington DC area. I have experience working in
                        business intelligence, data visualization, and finance, so I’m interested in projects that can
                        combine these areas.
                    </p>

                <h2> About Me </h2>
                <p>
                    In my prior work experiences, I’ve had the chance to use software tools such as SQL, Tableau,
                    and R. I’m excited to collaborate with other developers to incorporate these tools into
                    interesting data-centric web projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I’m not coding, I really enjoy learning about new topics. I regularly take online classes
                    and have been able to travel to 35 different countries on 6 continents to learn more about
                    different parts of the world. Additionally, I regularly play in 3.5 level tennis leagues
                    throughout the Washington DC area.
